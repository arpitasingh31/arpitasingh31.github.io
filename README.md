## 👋 Welcome to My Developer Blog!

Hello! I'm **Arpita Singh**, an aspiring **Software Developer** and **Data Analyst**.  
Today marks the first day of documenting my tech learning journey.

This blog is my public learning log where I will:
- Share daily updates of what I’m learning
- Post project progress
- Reflect on challenges and breakthroughs
- Build a visible, searchable portfolio

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Created a **GitHub repository**: `arpitasingh31.github.io`
- Set up **GitHub Pages** using **Jekyll** with the `minima` theme
- Learned how to write blog posts in **Markdown**
- Published this first post using Jekyll’s `_posts/` structure

---

## 🎯 Why This Blog?

- To stay consistent and focused on learning
- To build a professional online presence
- To organize my thoughts and improve technical writing
- To help others who are following the same path

---

## 🛠️ My Current Tech Stack Goals

### 🧑‍💻 Software Development
- Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- Git, GitHub, Web Hosting

### 📊 Data Analytics
- SQL, Excel, pandas, Power BI/Tableau
- Real-world data projects and dashboards

---

## 🗂️ Projects I Plan to Build

1. 🏨 **Hotel Management System**  
   → Features: Admin login, room booking, user registration, invoice generation

2. 📰 **Blogging Website**  
   → With categories, user posts, admin panel, and Markdown support

---


## What I Did Today
- Learned about Python variables, data types, and input/output.
- Completed 2 exercises from W3Schools and GeeksforGeeks.

## Project Update
- Created the basic structure of my Hotel Management System.
- Planned the modules: login, registration, booking.
## 🔜 What’s Next (Day 2 Goals)

- Revise Python basics: variables, data types, loops
- Design the database schema for the hotel system
- Start initial work on the hotel system’s **user login module**
- ## Tomorrow's Plan
- Start Django tutorials.
- Set up admin panel for hotel system.

## ✅ What I Did Today

### 📌 Python Revision
- Reviewed key concepts:
  - Variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  - Loops: `for`, `while`, and `break`/`continue`
  - Basic functions using `def`
- Practiced small problems like:
  - Prime number checker
  - Simple calculator using functions

### 🏨 Project: Hotel Management System – Login Module

- **Planned the login system structure**:
  - Admin login with username/password
  - Basic authentication using Python logic
- Created a rough **database schema**:
  - `admin` table: `id`, `username`, `password`
  - `customers` table: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`
- Sketched the UI flow:
  1. Login Page → Admin Panel
  2. If login fails → Retry/Reset options

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Python functions make code modular and reusable
- Thinking in terms of user flow (UX) is important for designing login logic
- Learned how to hash passwords using `hashlib` (for security in the future)

---

## 🚧 Challenges

- Faced syntax issues in defining functions
- Confused between `input()` data types (string vs integer)
- Needed time to plan the database flow clearly

---

## 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan (Day 3)

- Start coding the **login module** (text-based interface)
- Build a mock admin panel using Python and menus
- Set up SQLite to store admin credentials

---
