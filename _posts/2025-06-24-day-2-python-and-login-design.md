## ✅ What I Did Today

### 📌 Python Revision
- Reviewed key concepts:
  - Variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  - Loops: `for`, `while`, and `break`/`continue`
  - Basic functions using `def`
- Practiced small problems like:
  - Prime number checker
  - Simple calculator using functions

### 🏨 Project: Hotel Management System – Login Module

- **Planned the login system structure**:
  - Admin login with username/password
  - Basic authentication using Python logic
- Created a rough **database schema**:
  - `admin` table: `id`, `username`, `password`
  - `customers` table: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`
- Sketched the UI flow:
  1. Login Page → Admin Panel
  2. If login fails → Retry/Reset options

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Python functions make code modular and reusable
- Thinking in terms of user flow (UX) is important for designing login logic
- Learned how to hash passwords using `hashlib` (for security in the future)

---

## 🚧 Challenges

- Faced syntax issues in defining functions
- Confused between `input()` data types (string vs integer)
- Needed time to plan the database flow clearly

---

## 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan (Day 3)

- Start coding the **login module** (text-based interface)
- Build a mock admin panel using Python and menus
- Set up SQLite to store admin credentials
